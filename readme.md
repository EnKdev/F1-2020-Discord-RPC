### F1 2020 Rich Presence for Discord
Simple Discord RPC client for the game F1 2020.

##### To-do List

- [x] Set the current track image when on track instead of showing the F1 2020 Logo
- [ ] GUI for the application
- [ ] Show if the user is playing **Singleplayer** or **Multiplayer**

Not the best code, still needs to be polished and more things need to be added.

**Remember to set the Client ID of your RPC inside index.js**

##### Test the project
`npm start`

##### Build
`npm run package-win`

##### Releases
If you're too lazy to build it yourself or you don't have Node.js installed on your local machine, then you can also always grab a pre-built binary release from [here](https://github.com/EnKdev/F1-2020-Discord-RPC/releases).

Current Version: 1.1.0

##### Noteworthy info:
This repository is a **fork** of Flamehaze7's [F1 2020 Discord RPC Repository](https://github.com/Flamehaze7/F1-2020-Discord-RPC) where I build missing features as well as my own additions ontop of it. I may am going to open Pull Requests to the original repo, but given that it hasn't been worked on for around 5 months by now, I assume that they lost interrest to keep working on it. If not however, feel free to reach out to me!
