### F1 2020 Rich Presence for Discord
Simple Discord RPC client for the game F1 2020.

##### To-do List

- [ ] Set the current track image when on track instead of showing the F1 2020 Logo
- [ ] GUI for the application
- [ ] Show if the user is playing **Singleplayer** or **Multiplayer**

Not the best code, still needs to be polished and more things need to be added.

##### Test the project
`npm start`

##### Build
`npm run package-win`
